# Cleaning


## Looking at raw data

I looked through each of the data sets below noting the important columns, differences between the data sets and things I need to clean.

* column names to be made the same
* data needs to be pivoted to allow a join
* need to add a unique id for each person for grouping when answering future questions
* timestamp can be replaced with straight up year column




```{r}
candy_2015 <- read_excel(here::here("raw_data/boing-boing-candy-2015.xlsx"))
head(candy_2015)

candy_2016 <- read_excel(here::here("raw_data/boing-boing-candy-2016.xlsx"))
head(candy_2016)

candy_2017 <- read_excel(here::here("raw_data/boing-boing-candy-2017.xlsx"))
head(candy_2017)
```

## Pre bind cleaning

The below code shows:

* Selection of important columns.
* Creation of year and id. 
* Also for 2015 country and gender columns needed to be created as they weren't present in the original data.
* Columns are renamed to be consistent with other tables.
* Columns are reordered.
* Table is pivoted put all the candy bar columns in to one long **candy** column and their ratings into a **rating** column.
* Candy column mutated to remove brackets at beginning and end.

A similar process was followed for the 2016 and 2017 data
  
```{r}
candy_2015 <- candy_2015 %>%
  add_column(gender = as.character(NA), 
             country = as.character(NA),
             state = as.character(NA),
             .after = 2) %>% 
  rename(
    age = "How old are you?",
    going_out = "Are you going actually going trick or treating yourself?",
    "[JoyJoy (Mit Iodine!)]" = "[JoyJoy (Mit Iodine)]"
  )
candy_2015_piv <- candy_2015 %>%
  tidy_candy(2015)
```


Output of the above code gives a really long table with 8 columns. Column names and number are consistent now across all three tables. 


```{r echo=TRUE}


head(candy_2015_piv)

```


```{r include=FALSE}
# hidden

candy_2016 <- candy_2016 %>%
  rename(
    going_out = "Are you going actually going trick or treating yourself?",
    gender = "Your gender:",
    age = "How old are you?",
    country = "Which country do you live in?",
    "[box’o’ raisins]" = "[Box'o'Raisins]"
  )
candy_2016_piv <- candy_2016 %>%
  tidy_candy(2016)


candy_2017 <- candy_2017 %>%
  rename(
    "Q6 | Anonymous brown globs that come in black and orange wrappers" =
      "Q6 | Anonymous brown globs that come in black and orange wrappers	(a.k.a. Mary Janes)",
    "Q6 | Box’o’ Raisins" = "Q6 | Box'o'Raisins"
  )
candy_2017_piv <- candy_2017 %>%
  tidy_candy(2017)

source(here::here("data_cleaning_scripts/alternate_method_countries.R"))
```


## Bind and post bind cleaning 

* Using bind_rows the three tables were bound together.
* I then investigated the distinct values in the country.
* I grouped the distinct values into the below groups. 
* Any entry that reasonably be assumed to be referring to a specific country was added to the group for that country i.e. Usa! Usa! Usa! assumed to be usa. 
* Countries that only had one unique entry could be grouped together.
* All other entries assumed invalid and were set to NA
* Age column mutated to remove invalid entries.
* Invalid entries were taken as entries that were numeric characters (numbers with and without decimal points were included).
* Invalid entries set to 0.
* Type chnaged to numeric.
* Valid age range assumed to be  5 < age < 101, anything outside of this range set 0.
* All 0's set to NA

```{r}
candy_all_years <-
  bind_rows(candy_2015_piv, candy_2016_piv, candy_2017_piv) %>%
  mutate(
    country = tolower(country),
    country =
      case_when(
        country %in% usa_group ~ "usa",
        country %in% uk_group ~ "uk",
        country %in% spain_group ~ "spain",
        country %in% south_korea_group ~ "south korea",
        country %in% netherlands_group ~ "netherlands",
        country %in% canada_group ~ "canada",
        country %in% other_valid_countries ~ country)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    age = case_when(str_detect(age, "[^0-9\\.]") ~ "0",
                    TRUE ~ age),
    age = round(as.numeric(age)),
    age = case_when(age < 101 & age > 5 ~ age)
  ) %>% 
  verify(country %in% c("usa", "uk", "spain", "south korea", "netherlands", "canada", other_valid_countries, NA)) %>% 
  verify((age > 5 & age < 101) | is.na(age))

## Write to csv

* New cleaned data written to csv file.


# Analysing Data

## Read in clean data

* clean data read into analysis notebook

```{r include=FALSE}
candy_data <- read_csv(here::here("clean_data/candys_data_clean.csv"))
```

## Answer question

Q1. What is the total number of candy ratings given across the three years. (Number of candy ratings, not the number of raters. Don’t count missing values)

* There is a ratings column that contains all of the ratings made across all three year. 
* I just counted the number of rows.
* First I dropped NAs on rating so that the missing values were excluded.


<details>
<summary>**Answer**</summary>

```{r echo=TRUE}
candy_data %>% 
  drop_na(rating) %>% 
  summarise(n = n())
```
</details>


Q2. What was the average age of people who are going out trick or treating?

*  I used 3 different methods to solve this: droping NAs on age, imputing with mean and imputing with median.
* It is important to group by id here as the origninal columns had different numbers of question meaning after the pivot each persons age appears in a different number of rows. Grouping by id collapses this back down so that each persons age appears once, therefore not skewing the averages.
* I created a function to find the mean as I had to do it many times.
